## 摘要
从`分叉区块号（FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER）`开始，客户端基于将难度炸弹推迟 10,500,000 个区块的伪区块号来计算区块难度。

## 动机
在 2022 年 5 月之前完成上海升级或是合并。届时可以重新调整炸弹时间，或将其全部拆除。

## 规格
#### 用伪区块号缓解难度
为了实现 `calc_difficulty` ，只需将 `block.number` 部分进行替换，就像在冰川时代部分中使用的那样，公式如下：
```py
    fake_block_number = max(0, block.number - 10_500_000) if block.number >= FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER else block.number
```
## 基本原理

The following script predicts a 0.25 second delay to block time by May 2022 and a 1 second delay by June. This gives reason to address because the effect will be seen, but not so much urgency we don't have space to work around if needed.

```python
def predict_diff_bomb_effect(current_blknum, current_difficulty, block_adjustment, months):
    '''
    Predicts the effect on block time (as a ratio) in a specified amount of months in the future.
    Vars used for predictions:
    current_blknum = 13346561
    current_difficulty = 9191929451665642
    block adjustment = 10500000
    months = 7 # May 2022
    months = 8 # June 2022
    '''
    blocks_per_month = (86400 * 30) // 13.3
    future_blknum = current_blknum + blocks_per_month * months
    diff_adjustment = 2 ** ((future_blknum - block_adjustment) // 100000 - 2)
    diff_adjust_coeff = diff_adjustment / current_difficulty * 2048
    return diff_adjust_coeff


diff_adjust_coeff = predict_diff_bomb_effect(13346561,9191929451665642,10500000,6.5)
```

## Backwards Compatibility
No known backward compatibility issues.

## Security Considerations
Misjudging the effects of the difficulty can mean longer blocktimes than anticipated until a hardfork is released. Wild shifts in difficulty can affect this number severely. Also, gradual changes in blocktimes due to longer-term adjustments in difficulty can affect the timing of difficulty bomb epochs. This affects the usability of the network but unlikely to have security ramifications.
